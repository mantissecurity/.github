# Mantis Security

Welcome to Mantis Security.

Mantis Security is an all-volunteer organization focused on the safety and security of the open source ecosystem. We have a talent pool of competent programmers, developers, and infrastructure specialists with a large coverage and depth of knowledge spanning most modern technologies. Originating as a concerted effort to identify and reverse malicious packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI), Mantis Security has developed numerous original tools regarding the identification, analysis, and reversal of malicious programs written in a variety of languages. 

To date, Mantis Security has identified, reversed, analyzed, and reported over 100 malicious packages on the Python Package Index, and continually coordinates with cybersecurity organizations on the analysis and development of new tools and technologies to create a more secure open source ecosystem for users. 

We maintain several closed source projects:
* Dragonfly, a combined C2 and malware scanning service focused on the early identification, anlysis, and reporting of malicious packages on the Python Package Index. 
* Alessia, a Discord-bot based front end for interaction with the Dragonfly API. 
* Mantis Deobfuscator, an all-in-one deobfuscation suite to facilitate rapid reversal and analysis of Python based malware.
