# Vipyr Security

Welcome to Vipyr Security.

Vipyr Security is an all-volunteer organization focused on the safety and security of the open source ecosystem. We have
a talent pool of competent programmers, developers, and infrastructure specialists with a large coverage and depth of
knowledge spanning most modern technologies. Originating as a concerted effort to identify and reverse malicious
packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI), Vipyr Security has developed numerous original tools regarding the
identification, analysis, and reversal of malicious programs.

To date, Vipyr Security has identified, reversed, analyzed, and reported over 500 malicious packages on the Python
Package Index, and continually coordinates with cybersecurity organizations on the development of new tools and
technologies to create a more secure open source ecosystem for users.

We maintain several projects:

- Dragonfly, a combined C2 and malware scanning service focused on the early identification, analysis, and reporting of
  malicious packages on the Python Package Index.
- Alessia, a Discord-bot based front end for interaction with the Dragonfly API.
- Vipyr Deobfuscator, an all-in-one deobfuscation suite to facilitate rapid reversal and analysis of Python based
  malware.
